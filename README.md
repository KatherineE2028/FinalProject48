Description and links to the datasets used:

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data (Tommy)
I think that this data will be the best indicator of the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Crime rates and arrests are super important when deciding the safety of a neighborhood to live in.

Police incidents are important and relevant to safety. This is because even a stop sign violation or running a red light can jeopardize people’s safety. These incidents could also mean robberies, arrests, etc. This information and data set is crucial to determine the amount of safety in a neighborhood.

I think that a safe neighborhood could be best qualified by the amount of car crashes reported in the area. If there are repeated reports of car accidents, then it could be considered a bad neighborhood especially if someone is looking to raise children.

Safe neighborhoods should have the least amount of fire incidents. Fire hurts.

One sentence overview: 
We are doing a project determing which neighborhood is the safest based off these datasets.
