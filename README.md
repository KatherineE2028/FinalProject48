I think that this data will be the best indicator of the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Crime rates and arrests are super important when deciding the safety of a neighborhood to live in.

Police incidents are important and relevant to safety. This is because even a stop sign violation or running a red light can jeopardize people’s safety. These incidents could also mean robberies, arrests, etc. This information and data set is crucial to determine the amount of safety in a neighborhood.

I think that a safe neighborhood could be best qualified by the average speed limit of the neighborhood, especially for families looking to raise children, this way the risk factor for car accidents can be most easily avoided.

Safe neighborhoods should have the least amount of fire incidents. Fire hurts.
