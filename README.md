Description and links to the datasets used:
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data (Tommy)
I think that this data will be the best indicator of the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Crime rates and arrests are super important when deciding the safety of a neighborhood to live in. 

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality (Katie)
I think air quality is also a very important factor in choosing the best neighborhood. If the land is nice but the air quality is barely habitable, then I would consider it a bad neighborhood. Air quality is also an important factor when thinking about safety. 

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-crash-data(Owen)
I think that a safe neighborhood could be best qualified by the amount of car crashes reported in the area. If there are repeated reports of car accidents, then it could be considered a bad neighborhood especially if someone is looking to raise children.

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh(Ya Wei)
Safe neighborhoods should have the least amount of fire incidents. Fire hurts.

One sentence overview: We are doing a project determing which neighborhood is the safest based off these datasets.
